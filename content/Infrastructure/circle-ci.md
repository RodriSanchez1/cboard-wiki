/* Title: Circle CI configuration  */

## Circle CI

The following repos has CircleCI configured just to build on each push, and publish a new docker image: `cboard`, `cboard-api`, `cboard-bootstrap` and `cboard-letsencrypt`.

CircleCI workflows for `cboard` and `cboard-api` will update each service in QA.
